    "\n",
    "This proposition is not my own but was devised by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and I was captivated by this idea after coming across the Kaggle's competition website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition is currently live and ends December 19, 2019. This suits the curriculum of the Data Incubator program, which in turn keeps my motivation higher and stay focused on the topic."

    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Metered building energy usage helps us consume fuel and water wisely while inspiring us to improve building efficiencies to reduce costs and emissions by installing and/or improving retrofit components of the buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the pay-for-performance financing, the building owner makes payments based on the difference between their real energy consumption and what they would have used without any retrofits. The latter values have to come from a model, which forms the objective of this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Current methods of estimation are fragmented and do not scale well. Some assume a specific meter type, or don't work with different building types. Building counterfactual models to estimate the usage seems the only way to assess the energy consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, I intend to work toward building accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is for public use but available to Kaggle users (upon registration), and is hosted by ASHRAE at kaggle.com website. The data comes from hourly meter readings taken during a three-year timeframe of over 1000 buildings located at different sites worldwide."
